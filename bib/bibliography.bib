              models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options
              include autocorrelation of the response variable, user defined
              covariance structures, censored data, as well as meta-analytic
              standard errors. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly
              encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually
              reflect their beliefs. In addition, model fit can easily be
              assessed and compared with the Watanabe-Akaike information

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Current guidelines recommend endotracheal tubes with
              subglottic secretion drainage to prevent ventilator-associated
              pneumonia. Subglottic secretion drainage is associated with fewer
              ventilator-associated pneumonia diagnoses, but it is unclear to
              what extent this reflects fewer invasive pneumonias versus fewer
              false-positive diagnoses due to less secretions and/or less
              microbial colonization of the oropharynx. We, therefore,
              undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of
              subglottic secretion drainage on duration of mechanical
              ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay,
              ventilator-associated events, mortality, antibiotic utilization,
              stridor, and reintubations to better understand the net benefits
              and limitations of this intervention. DATA SOURCES: We searched
              Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature,
              Excerpta Medica Database, and PubMed from inception through
              February 22, 2015, without language restrictions. STUDY
              SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials comparing subglottic
              secretion drainage versus no subglottic secretion drainage in
              adult patients on mechanical ventilation. DATA EXTRACTION:
              Eligible trials were abstracted and assessed for risk of bias by
              two reviewers. DATA SYNTHESIS: We identified 17 eligible trials
              with a total of 3,369 patients. Subglottic secretion drainage was
              associated with lower ventilator-associated pneumonia rates (risk
              ratio, 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.51-0.67; I2 = 0\%), but there were no
              significant differences between groups in duration of mechanical
              ventilation (weighted mean difference, -0.16 d; 95\% CI, -0.64 to
              0.33; I2 = 0\%), ICU length of stay (weighted mean difference,
              +0.17 d; 95\% CI, -0.62 to 0.95; I2 = 0\%), hospital length of
              stay (weighted mean difference, -0.57 d; 95\% CI, -2.44 to 1.30;
              I2 = 0\%), ventilator-associated events (risk ratio, 0.97; 95\%
              CI, 0.65-1.43), or mortality (risk ratio, 0.93; 95\% CI,
              0.84-1.03; I2 = 0\%). Two studies observed significantly less
              antibiotic use with subglottic secretion drainage whereas a third
              did not. There were no significant differences between groups in
              stridor or reintubations. CONCLUSIONS: Subglottic secretion
              drainage is associated with lower ventilator-associated pneumonia
              rates but does not clearly decrease duration of mechanical
              ventilation, length of stay, ventilator-associated events,
              mortality, or antibiotic usage. Further data are required to
              demonstrate the benefits of subglottic secretion drainage.",

               Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov
               chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an
               adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized
               maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization
               methods such as the limited memory
               Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a
               platform for computing log densities and their gradients and
               Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as
               variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal
               inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is
               set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along
               with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance
               probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from
               the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the
               rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All

              conditions involving worsening oxygenation have been recently
              proposed to make surveillance of events possibly linked to
              ventilator-associated pneumonia as objective as possible. The
              objective of the study was to confirm the effect of subglottic
              secretion suctioning on ventilator-associated pneumonia
              prevalence and to assess its concomitant impact on
              ventilator-associated conditions and antibiotic use. DESIGN:
              Randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in five ICUs of
              the same hospital. PATIENTS: Three hundred fifty-two adult
              patients intubated with a tracheal tube allowing subglottic
              secretion suctioning were randomly assigned to undergo suctioning
              (n = 170, group 1) or not (n = 182, group 2). MAIN RESULTS:
              During ventilation, microbiologically confirmed
              ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in 15 patients (8.8\%)
              of group 1 and 32 patients (17.6\%) of group 2 (p = 0.018). In
              terms of ventilatory days, ventilator-associated pneumonia rates
              were 9.6 of 1,000 ventilatory days and 19.8 of 1,000 ventilatory
              days, respectively (p = 0.0076). Ventilator-associated condition
              prevalence was 21.8\% in group 1 and 22.5\% in group 2 (p =
              0.84). Among the 47 patients with ventilator-associated
              pneumonia, 25 (58.2\%) experienced a ventilator-associated
              condition. Neither length of ICU stay nor mortality differed
              between groups; only ventilator-associated condition was
              associated with increased mortality. The total number of
              antibiotic days was 1,696 in group 1, representing 61.6\% of the
              2,754 ICU days, and 1,965 in group 2, representing 68.5\% of the
              2,868 ICU days (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Subglottic secretion
              suctioning resulted in a significant reduction of
              ventilator-associated pneumonia prevalence associated with a
              significant decrease in antibiotic use. By contrast,
              ventilator-associated condition occurrence did not differ between
              groups and appeared more related to other medical features than
              ventilator-associated pneumonia.",

              surveillance paradigm for monitoring complications in
              mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care units (ICUs).
              The National Healthcare Safety Network replaced traditional
              ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) surveillance with VAE
              surveillance in 2013. The objective of this study was to assess
              the consistency between VAE surveillance and traditional VAP
              surveillance. METHODS: We systematically searched electronic
              reference databases for articles describing VAE and VAP in ICUs.
              Pooled VAE prevalence, pooled estimates (sensitivity,
              specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative
              predictive value (NPV)) of VAE for the detection of VAP, and
              pooled estimates (weighted mean difference (WMD) and odds ratio
              ([OR)) of risk factors for VAE compared to VAP were calculated.
              RESULTS: From 2191 screened titles, 18 articles met our inclusion
              criteria, representing 61,489 patients receiving mechanical
              ventilation at ICUs in eight countries. The pooled prevalence
              rates of ventilator-associated conditions (VAC),
              infection-related VAC (IVAC), possible VAP, probable VAP, and
              traditional VAP were 13.8 \%, 6.4 \%, 1.1 \%, 0.9 \%, and 11.9
              \%, respectively. Pooled sensitivity and PPV of each VAE type for
              VAP detection did not exceed 50 \%, while pooled specificity and
              NPV exceeded 80 \%. Compared with VAP, pooled ORs of in-hospital
              death were 1.49 for VAC and 1.76 for IVAC; pooled WMDs of
              hospital length of stay were -4.27 days for VAC and -5.86 days
              for IVAC; and pooled WMDs of ventilation duration were -2.79 days
              for VAC and -2.89 days for IVAC. CONCLUSIONS: VAE surveillance
              missed many cases of VAP, and the population characteristics
              identified by the two surveillance paradigms differed. VAE
              surveillance does not accurately detect cases of traditional VAP

  abstract = "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released
              ventilator-associated event (VAE) definitions in 2013. The new
              definitions were designed to track episodes of sustained
              respiratory deterioration in mechanically ventilated patients
              after a period of stability or improvement. More than 2,000 U.S.
              hospitals have reported their VAE rates to the CDC, but there has
              been little guidance to date on how to prevent VAEs. Existing
              ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention bundles are unlikely
              to be optimal insofar as pneumonia accounts for only a minority
              of VAEs. This review proposes a framework and potential
              intervention set to prevent VAEs on the basis of studies of VAE
              epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention. Work to date suggests
              that the majority of VAEs are caused by four conditions:
              pneumonia, fluid overload, atelectasis, and acute respiratory
              distress syndrome. Interventions that minimize ventilator
              exposure and target one or more of these conditions may therefore
              prevent VAEs. Potential strategies include avoiding intubation,
              minimizing sedation, paired daily spontaneous awakening and
              breathing trials, early exercise and mobility, low tidal volume
              ventilation, conservative fluid management, and conservative
              blood transfusion thresholds. Interventional studies have thus
              far affirmed that minimized sedation, paired daily spontaneous
              awakening and breathing trials, and conservative fluid management
              can reduce VAE rates and improve patient-centered outcomes.
              Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of the other
              proposed interventions, to identify additional modifiable risk
              factors for VAEs, and to measure whether combining strategies
              into VAE prevention bundles confers additional benefits over
              implementing one or more of these interventions in isolation.",

              definitions in January 2013. Little is known about VAE
              prevention. We hypothesized that daily, coordinated spontaneous
              awakening trials (SATs) and spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs)
              might prevent VAEs. OBJECTIVES: To assess the preventability of
              VAEs. METHODS: We nested a multicenter quality improvement
              collaborative within a prospective study of VAE surveillance
              among 20 intensive care units between November 2011 and May 2013.
              Twelve units joined the collaborative and implemented an opt-out
              protocol for nurses and respiratory therapists to perform paired
              daily SATs and SBTs. The remaining eight units conducted
              surveillance alone. We measured temporal trends in VAEs using
              generalized mixed effects regression models adjusted for
              patient-level unit, age, sex, reason for intubation, Sequential
              Organ Failure Assessment score, and comorbidity index.
              MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We tracked 5,164 consecutive
              episodes of mechanical ventilation: 3,425 in collaborative units
              and 1,739 in surveillance-only units. Within collaborative units,
              significant increases in SATs, SBTs, and percentage of SBTs
              performed without sedation were mirrored by significant decreases
              in duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital
              length-of-stay. There was no change in VAE risk per ventilator
              day but significant decreases in VAE risk per episode of
              mechanical ventilation (odds ratio [OR], 0.63; 95\% confidence
              interval [CI], 0.42-0.97) and infection-related
              ventilator-associated complications (OR, 0.35; 95\% CI,
              0.17-0.71) but not pneumonias (OR, 0.51; 95\% CI, 0.19-1.3).
              Within surveillance-only units, there were no significant changes
              in SAT, SBT, or VAE rates. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced performance of
              paired, daily SATs and SBTs is associated with lower VAE rates.

  abstract = "Daily oral care with chlorhexidine for mechanically ventilated
              patients is ubiquitous in contemporary intensive care practice.
              The practice is predicated upon meta-analyses suggesting that
              adding chlorhexidine to daily oral care regimens can reduce
              ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) rates by up to 40\%. Close
              analysis, however, raises three concerns: (1) the meta-analyses
              are dominated by studies in cardiac surgery patients in whom
              average duration of mechanical ventilation is < 1 day and thus
              their risk of VAP is very different from other populations, (2)
              diagnosing VAP is subjective and nonspecific yet the
              meta-analyses gave equal weight to blinded and nonblinded
              studies, potentially biasing them in favor of chlorhexidine, and
              (3) there is circularity between diagnostic criteria for VAP and
              chlorhexidine; as an antiseptic, chlorhexidine may decrease the
              frequency of positive respiratory cultures but fewer cultures
              does not necessarily mean fewer pneumonias. It is therefore
              important to look at other outcomes for corollary evidence on
              whether or not oral chlorhexidine benefits patients. An updated
              meta-analysis restricted to double-blinded studies in noncardiac
              surgery patients showed no impact on VAP rates, duration of
              mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit length of stay.
              Instead, there was a possible signal that oral chlorhexidine may
              increase mortality rates. Observational data have raised similar
              concerns. This article will review the theoretical basis for
              adding chlorhexidine to oral care regimens, delineate potential
              biases in randomized controlled trials comparing oral care
              regimens with and without chlorhexidine, explore the unexpected
              mortality signal associated with oral chlorhexidine, and provide
              practical recommendations.",

              Patients with minimal and stable ventilator settings may be

              and stable ventilator settings treated with 1-3 days vs >3 days
              of antibiotics. Methods: We identified consecutive adult patients
              started on antibiotics for possible VAP with daily minimum
              positive end-expiratory pressure of $\leq$5 cm H2O and fraction
              of inspired oxygen $\leq$40\% for at least 3 days within a large

              extubation alive vs ventilator death and time to hospital
              discharge alive vs hospital death using competing risks models
              among patients prescribed 1-3 days vs >3 days of antibiotics. All
              models were adjusted for patient demographics, comorbidities,
              severity of illness, clinical signs of infection, and pathogens.
              Results: There were 1290 eligible patients, 259 treated for 1-3
              days and 1031 treated for >3 days. The 2 groups had similar
              demographics, comorbidities, and clinical signs. There were no

              treatment; 95\% confidence interval [CI], .98-1.36), ventilator

  abstract = "In 2013, the United States Centers for Disease Control and
              Prevention redefined surveillance for quality of care in
              ventilated patients by shifting from ventilator-associated
              pneumonia (VAP) definitions to ventilator-associated event (VAE)
              definitions. VAE definitions were designed to overcome many of
              the limitations of VAP definitions, including their complexity,
              subjectivity, limited correlation with outcomes, and incomplete
              capture of many important and morbid complications of mechanical
              ventilation. VAE definitions broadened the focus of surveillance
              from pneumonia alone to the syndrome of nosocomial complications
              in ventilated patients, as marked by sustained increases in
              ventilator settings after a period of stable or decreasing
              ventilator settings. Qualitative studies suggest that most VAEs
              are caused by pneumonia, fluid overload, ARDS, and atelectasis.
              Only about 40\% of clinically diagnosed VAPs meet VAE criteria,
              likely because the VAE requirement for a sustained increase in
              ventilator settings sets a threshold effect that selects for
              patients with severe disease. VAEs are associated with a doubling
              of the risk of death compared to patients without VAEs and
              compared to patients who meet traditional VAP criteria. Risk
              factors for VAEs include sedation with benzodiazepines or
              propofol, volume overload, high tidal-volume ventilation, high
              inspiratory driving pressures, oral care with chlorhexidine,
              blood transfusions, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and patient
              transport. Potential strategies to prevent VAEs include
              minimizing sedation, paired daily spontaneous awakening and
              breathing trials, early mobility, conservative fluid management,
              conservative transfusion thresholds, and low tidal-volume
              ventilation. A limited number of studies that have tested subsets
              of these interventions have reported substantial decreases in
              VAEs; no group, however, has thus far assessed the impact of a
              fully optimized VAE prevention bundle that includes all of these
              interventions upon VAE rates and other outcomes.",

              complications in ventilated patients, ventilator-associated
              events (VAEs), to replace ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
              VAEs consist of ventilator-associated conditions (VAC),
              infection-related ventilator-associated complications (IVAC), and
              possible VAP. A duration of mechanical ventilation of at least 4
              d is required to diagnose VAE. However, the observed duration of
              mechanical ventilation was < 4 d in many previous studies. We
              evaluated the impact of VAEs on clinical outcomes in critically
              ill subjects who required mechanical ventilation for $\geq$ 4 d.

              conducted in the general ICU of an academic hospital. We included
              407 adult subjects who were admitted to the ICU and required
              mechanical ventilation for at least 4 d. VAC and IVAC were
              identified from the electronic medical records. VAP was defined
              according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2008
              criteria and was identified from the surveillance data of the
              infection control team of our hospital. Clinical outcomes were
              studied in the VAC, IVAC, and VAP groups. Possible VAP was not
              investigated. RESULTS: Higher mortality was seen in VAC and IVAC
              subjects, but not in VAP subjects, compared with those without
              VAEs and VAP. By multivariable hazard analysis for hospital
              mortality, IVAC was independently associated with hospital
              mortality (hazard ratio 2.42, 95\% CI 1.39-4.20, P = .002). VAC
              also tended to show a similar association with hospital mortality
              (hazard ratio 1.45, 95\% CI 0.97-2.18, P = .07). On the other
              hand, VAP did not increase a hazard of hospital death (hazard
              ratio 1.08, 95\% CI 0.44-2.66, P = .87). CONCLUSIONS: We found
              that a VAE was related to hospital mortality in critically ill
              subjects with prolonged mechanical ventilation, and that VAP was
              not.",

              recently released new surveillance definitions for
              ventilator-associated events, including the new entities of
              ventilator-associated conditions and infection-related
              ventilator-associated complications. Both ventilator-associated
              conditions and infection-related ventilator-associated
              complications are associated with prolonged mechanical
              ventilation and hospital death, but little is known about their
              risk factors and how best to prevent them. We sought to identify
              risk factors for ventilator-associated conditions and
              infection-related ventilator-associated complications. DESIGN:
              Retrospective case-control study. SETTING: Medical, surgical,
              cardiac, and neuroscience units of a tertiary care teaching
              hospital. PATIENTS: Hundred ten patients with
              ventilator-associated conditions matched to 110 controls without
              ventilator-associated conditions on the basis of age, sex, ICU
              type, comorbidities, and duration of mechanical ventilation prior
              to ventilator-associated conditions. INTERVENTIONS: None.
              MEASUREMENTS: We compared cases with controls with regard to
              demographics, comorbidities, ventilator bundle adherence rates,
              sedative exposures, routes of nutrition, blood products, fluid
              balance, and modes of ventilatory support. We repeated the
              analysis for the subset of patients with infection-related
              ventilator-associated complications and their controls. MAIN
              RESULTS: Case and control patients were well matched on baseline
              characteristics. On multivariable logistic regression,
              significant risk factors for ventilator-associated conditions
              were mandatory modes of ventilation (odds ratio, 3.4; 95\% CI,
              1.6-8.0) and positive fluid balances (odds ratio, 1.2 per L
              positive; 95\% CI, 1.0-1.4). Possible risk factors for
              infection-related ventilator-associated complications were
              starting benzodiazepines prior to intubation (odds ratio, 5.0;
              95\% CI, 1.3-29), total opioid exposures (odds ratio, 3.3 per 100
              $\mu$g fentanyl equivalent/kg; 95\% CI, 0.90-16), and paralytic
              medications (odds ratio, 2.3; 95\% CI, 0.79-80). Traditional
              ventilator bundle elements, including semirecumbent positioning,
              oral care with chlorhexidine, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis,
              stress ulcer prophylaxis, daily spontaneous breathing trials, and
              sedative interruptions, were not associated with
              ventilator-associated conditions or infection-related
              ventilator-associated complications. CONCLUSIONS: Mandatory modes
              of ventilation and positive fluid balance are risk factors for
              ventilator-associated conditions. Benzodiazepines, opioids, and
              paralytic medications are possible risk factors for
              infection-related ventilator-associated complications.
              Prospective studies are needed to determine if targeting these
              risk factors can lower ventilator-associated condition and
              infection-related ventilator-associated complication rates.",

              death, but little is known about their risk factors and how best
              to prevent them. METHODS: We compared VAE cases with non-VAE
              cases with regard to demographics, comorbidities, sedative
              exposures, opioids exposures, paralytic exposures, routes of
              nutrition, blood products, gastric retention, and fluid balance.
              Patients mechanically ventilated for $\geq$4 days between January

              RESULTS: On multivariable logistic regression, significant risk

              Positive daily fluid balances of $\geq$50 mL, sedatives
              administered, and gastric retention of $\geq$200 mL are risk
              factors for VAEs. Intervention studies are needed to determine if

              (CDC) recently transitioned from ventilator-associated pneumonia
              (VAP) surveillance to ventilator-associated event (VAE)
              surveillance in adult inpatient settings. Since the transition,
              several modifications have been made to improve surveillance
              methods, and there is a growing body of data regarding the
              epidemiology, risk factors, and preventability of VAEs. RECENT
              FINDINGS: The VAE surveillance definition algorithm is based on
              objective criteria and includes three tiers:
              ventilator-associated conditions, infection-related
              ventilator-associated complications, and possible and probable
              VAP. VAE surveillance expands the purview of surveillance beyond
              pneumonia alone to include additional complications of mechanical
              ventilation. Most VAEs are caused by pneumonia, pulmonary edema,
              atelectasis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. VAEs are
              associated with adverse outcomes including prolonged mechanical
              ventilation, longer intensive care and hospital length-of-stay,
              and higher mortality rates. Studies to date suggest that
              minimizing sedation and optimizing fluid management can reduce
              VAE rates. SUMMARY: We review the CDC's recent updates on VAE
              surveillance definitions, methods, and tools, and provide an
              overview of the growing evidence base for VAE as a patient safety
              measure. Further work is needed to affirm and extend the current
              knowledge about how best to prevent VAEs.",

              approach to surveillance for ventilator-associated events in
              adult patients. DESIGN: The Centers for Disease Control and
              Prevention (CDC) convened a Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP)
              Surveillance Definition Working Group in September 2011. Working
              Group members included representatives of stakeholder societies
              and organizations and federal partners. MAIN RESULTS: The Working
              Group finalized a three-tier, adult surveillance definition
              algorithm for ventilator-associated events. The algorithm uses
              objective, readily available data elements and can identify a
              broad range of conditions and complications occurring in
              mechanically ventilated adult patients, including but not limited
              to VAP. The first tier definition, ventilator-associated
              condition (VAC), identifies patients with a period of sustained
              respiratory deterioration following a sustained period of
              stability or improvement on the ventilator, defined by changes in
              the daily minimum fraction of inspired oxygen or positive
              end-expiratory pressure. The second tier definition,
              infection-related ventilator-associated complication (IVAC),
              requires that patients with VAC also have an abnormal temperature
              or white blood cell count, and be started on a new antimicrobial
              agent. The third tier definitions, possible and probable VAP,
              require that patients with IVAC also have laboratory and/or
              microbiological evidence of respiratory infection. CONCLUSIONS:
              Ventilator-associated events surveillance was implemented in
              January 2013 in the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network.
              Modifications to improve surveillance may be made as additional

              for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are not
              fully understood. METHODS: We searched Cochrane Central, PubMed,
              and EMBASE up to March 2016 to identify randomized controlled
              trials (RCTs) that compared subglottic secretion suction versus
              non-subglottic secretion suction in adults with mechanical
              ventilation. Meta-analysis was conducted using Revman 5.3, trial
              sequential analysis (TSA) 0.9 and STATA 12.0. The primary outcome
              was incidence of VAP. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
              Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the
              level of evidence. RESULTS: Twenty RCTs (N = 3544) were
              identified. Subglottic secretion suction was associated with
              reduction of VAP incidence in four high quality trials (relative
              risk (RR) 0.54, 95 \% confidence interval (CI) 0.40-0.74; p <
              0.00001) and in all trials (RR = 0.55, 95 \% CI 0.48- 0.63; p <
              0.00001). Sensitivity analyses did not show differences in the
              pooled results. Additionally, the results of the above-mentioned
              analyses were confirmed in TSA. GRADE level was high. Subglottic
              secretion suction significantly reduced incidence of early onset
              VAP, gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria causing VAP, and
              duration of mechanical ventilation. It delayed the time-to-onset
              of VAP. However, no significant differences in late onset VAP,
              intensive care unit (ICU) mortality, hospital mortality, or ICU
              length of stay were found. CONCLUSIONS: Subglottic secretion
              suction decreased VAP incidence and duration of mechanical
              ventilation and delayed VAP onset. However, subglottic secretion
              suction did not reduce mortality and length of ICU stay.
              Subglottic secretion suction is recommended for preventing VAP

               Stan builds readers' knowledge of and confidence in statistical
               modeling. Reflecting the need for even minor programming in
               today's model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to
               perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated.
               This unique computational approach ensures that readers
               understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and
               interpretations in their own modeling work. The text presents
               generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian
               perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of
               Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the
               basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also
               discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process
               models for spatial and network autocorrelation. By using
               complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a
               practical foundation for performing statistical inference.
               Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the
               natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced
               or specialized statistical modeling. Web ResourceThe book is
               accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on
               the author's website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and
               map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated events (VAE), using objective
              diagnostic criteria, are the preferred quality indicator for
              patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) for greater than
              48 hours. We aim to identify the occurrence of VAE in our trauma
              population, the impact on survival, and length of stay, as
              compared to the traditional definition of ventilator-associated
              pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: This retrospective review included
              adult trauma patients, who were Washington residents, admitted
              between 2012 and 2017, and required at least 3 days of MV.
              Exclusions included patients with Abbreviated Injury Scale head
              score greater than 4 and burn related mechanisms of injury. We
              matched trauma registry data with our institutional,
              physician-adjudicated, and culture-confirmed ventilator event
              database. We compared the clinical outcomes of ventilator-free
              days, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of
              stay, and likelihood of death between VAE and VAP. RESULTS: One
              thousand five hundred thirty-three trauma patients met criteria;
              124 (8.1\%) patients developed VAE, 114 (7.4\%) patients
              developed VAP, and 63 (4.1\%) patients met criteria for both VAE
              and VAP. After adjusted analyses, patients with VAE were more
              likely to die (hazard ratio [HR], 2.86; 95\% confidence interval
              [CI], 1.44-5.68), than those with VAP, as well those patients
              with neither diagnosis (HR, 2.83; 95\% CI, 1.83-4.38). Patients
              with VAP were no more likely to die (HR, 1.55; 95\% CI,
              0.91-2.68) than those with neither diagnosis. Patients with VAE
              had fewer ventilator-free days than those with VAP (HR, -2.71;
              95\% CI, -4.74 to -0.68). CONCLUSION: Critically injured trauma
              patients who develop VAE are three times more likely to die and
              utilize almost 3 days more MV than those that develop VAP. The
              objective criteria of VAE make it a promising indicator on which
              quality indicator efforts should be focused. Future studies
              should be aimed at identification of modifiable risk factors for
              VAE and their impact on outcome, as these patients are at high
              risk for death. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Retrospective cohort study,

              Empiric evaluation of five approaches to the analysis of
              case-crossover data from a study of heavy physical exertion and
              acute myocardial infarction onset is shown. The data presented
              are from the Onset Study, a case-crossover study of the
              determinants of myocardial infarction onset conducted in 45
              centers from August 1989 to October 1992. In model 1, exactly one
              control period (matched on clock-time) was sampled per case. In
              models 2-4, up to 25 control periods were sampled, and the effect
              of clock-time on the baseline hazard of infarction was modeled.
              In model 5, a census of the person-time experienced by each
              subject over the year preceding the infarction was sampled. The
              95\% confidence interval for model 1 was 2.7 times wider, and the
              relative efficiency, defined as v infinity/vM, where vM
              represents the asymptotic variance estimate of the estimated log
              relative risk with M control periods sampled per case, was only
              about 14\% of model 5. In models 2-4, the efficiency increased

              ventilator-associated events (VAE) and a new VAE algorithm in the
              paediatric (Ped) population, the Ped-VAE. METHODS: We performed a
              prospective 13-month cohort study at a multidisciplinary
              paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Primary endpoints were
              duration of ventilation episode, PICU or hospitalization length
              of stay from episode and episode mortality. Episodes without VAE
              (or VAP/VAT) served as comparison groups. RESULTS: One hundred
              eight episodes of ventilation (99 children) with 2554
              ventilator-days were assessed. In episodes not meeting 2008 CDC
              definitions, a median of 6 ventilator-days (PICU stay 11 days)
              was documented (with eight deaths), not significantly different
              from episodes not meeting VAE or Ped-VAE definitions. Using 2008
              CDC criteria, 11 (10.2\%) respiratory infections (eight
              tracheobronchitis) were identified, seven VAEs using 2013 CDC
              criteria (6.4\%) and 29 (26.8\%) using Ped-VAE criteria (relative
              risk vs. 2008 CDC criteria 2.58; 95\% confidence interval
              1.36-4.91). In contrast with their comparison groups, episodes
              meeting 2008 CDC criteria did not significantly predict outcomes,
              whereas VAEs (only four possible VAPs) were associated with
              significantly more ventilation and PICU length of stay
              (12-day/8-day increase) and sevenfold increase in mortality.
              Ped-VAE did not increase mortality, but it was associated with
              4-day increase in ventilation and PICU length of stay, with ten
              possible VAPs, and atelectasis (9/12) as the main paediatric

              criteria did not predict outcomes, whereas VAE only identified
              very severe events. The Ped-VAE algorithm had more accuracy

              The new classification of ventilator-associated events (VAE)
              proposed by the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC)
              enhance the spectra of complications due to MV including both
              infection-related and non-infectious events. Both VAEs and VARIs
              are associated with prolonged duration of MV, longer stay in
              hospital and in the intensive care unit (ICU) and more antibiotic
              consumption, nonetheless patients with VAEs have worst outcomes.
              The VARI and VAE algorithms are focused on different targets and
              the correlation between both classifications is shown to be poor.
              The diagnostic criteria of the traditional classification have
              limited accuracy and the non-infectious complications may be
              misinterpreted as VARI. While the VAE surveillance enhances the
              spectra of MV complications but excludes less severe VARIs.
              Noninfective events explain up to 30\% of VAEs, the main causes
              being atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary
              edema and pulmonary embolism. The bundles assessing VAE are
              associated with less incidence of VAP and improved outcomes but
              they fail to reduce the rates of VAE. Automated VAE surveillance
              is efficient and useful as a quality indicator in the ICU while

              role in the design of global protocols and preventive strategies.

              correlation with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or
              tracheobronchitis (VAT). METHODS: This was a prospective,
              observational, multicenter, international study conducted at 13
              intensive care units (ICUs); thirty consecutive adults
              mechanically ventilated for $\geq$ 48 h per site were eligible,
              with daily follow-up being recorded in a collaborative web
              database; VAEs were assessed using the 2013 CDC classification
              and its 2015 update. RESULTS: A total of 2856 ventilator days in
              244 patients were analyzed, identifying 33 VAP and 51 VAT
              episodes; 30-day ICU mortality was significantly higher (42.8 vs.
              19.6\%, p < 0.007) in patients with VAP than in those with VAT.
              According to the 2013 CDC definitions, 117 VAEs were identified:
              113 (96\%) were infection-related ventilator-associated
              complication-plus (IVAC-plus), while possible
              ventilator-associated pneumonia (PVAP) was found in 64 (56.6\%)
              of them. VAE increased the number of ventilator days and
              prolonged ICU and hospital LOS (by 5, 11, and 12 days,
              respectively), with a trend towards increased 30-day mortality
              (43 vs 28\%, p = 0.06). Most episodes (26, 55\%) classified as
              IVAC-plus without PVAP criteria were due to atelectasis. PVAP
              significantly increased (p < 0.05) ventilator days as well as ICU
              and hospital LOS (by 10.5, 14, and 13 days, respectively). Only
              24 (72.7\%) of VAP and 15 (29.4\%) of VAT episodes met IVAC-plus
              criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory infections (mainly VAT) were
              the most common complication. VAE algorithms only identified
              events with surrogates of severe oxygenation deterioration. As a
              consequence, IVAC definitions missed one fourth of the episodes
              of VAP and three fourths of the episodes of VAT. Identifying VAT
              (often missed by IVAC-plus criteria) is important, as VAP and VAT
              have different impacts on mortality.",

              performed in six intensive care units (ICU) in four European
              countries (France, Greece, Spain and Turkey). The main objective
              was to identify factors associated with ventilator-associated
              events (VAEs) in adults who underwent mechanical ventilation (MV)
              $\geq$ 48 h. Secondary objectives were to identify: variables
              influencing VAE in the subpopulation with endotracheal intubation
              and in those subjects who were ventilated > 7 days. Subjects who
              had undergone MV $\geq$ 48 h were included. In subjects with
              multiple episodes of MV, only the first one was eligible. The
              adult definitions for VAEs were adjusted to the 2015 update of
              the CDC's 2013 National Healthcare Safety Network Association.
              Factors associated with VAE were estimated through multivariate
              Cox proportional hazards analysis. Among 163 adults (42
              tracheostomies), 76 VAEs (34.9 VAEs/1,000 ventilator-days) were
              documented: 9 were Ventilator-Associated Conditions (VAC) and 67
              Infection-related Ventilator-Associated Complications (IVAC)-plus
              (9 only IVAC and 58 Possible Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia).
              VAEs developed after a median of 6 days (interquartile range:
              4-9). VAEs were independently associated with long-acting
              sedative/analgesic drugs (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 4.30), selective
              digestive decontamination (SDD) (HR: 0.38), and surgical/trauma
              admission (HR: 2.30). Among 116 subjects with endotracheal tube,
              SDD (HR: 0.21) and surgical/trauma admission (HR: 3.11) remained
              associated with VAE. Among 102 subjects ventilated >7 days, only
              long-acting sedative/analgesic agents (HR: 8.69) remained
              independently associated with VAE. In summary, SDD implementation
              and long-acting analgesic/sedative agents restriction
              prescription may prevent early and late VAEs, respectively.

               sets: use of conditional likelihood and random-effects models.
               Conditioning is more traditional and has attractive robustness
               properties. Contemporary random-effects approaches rely more on
               accurate assumptions but can be applied to a larger class of
               problems. For pair-matched studies with arbitrary numbers of
               categorical covariates, we reconcile these two approaches,
               showing that the conditional approach has an exact
               interpretation as a specific type of random-effects model. The
               random-effects models that provide equivalence with conditioning
               naturally inherit all the attractive properties of that
               approach, and we argue they are a pragmatic model choice. We
               also discuss desirable characteristics of the random-effects
               model that are entirely novel and that have foundational
               implications. For example, although our model is specified
               entirely within a full-likelihood framework, its assumed
               random-effects distribution does not need a parametric form; we
               make explicit the robustness that this provides. In addition,
               our model forces a priori exchangeability of case and control
               status, an attractive property for objective analyses. The
               equivalence of the two approaches justifies extensions of
               conditional likelihood methods to new situations. We give a
               motivating example from a real problem concerning
               misclassification error in a genotyping process, and discuss

              implemented a new, multitiered definition for
              ventilator-associated events (VAEs) to replace their former
              definition of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). We
              hypothesized that the new definition could be implemented in an
              automated, efficient, and reliable manner using the electronic
              health record and that the new definition would identify
              different patients than those identified under the previous
              definition. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis
              using an automated algorithm to analyze all patients admitted to
              the ICU at a single urban, tertiary-care hospital from 2008 to
              2013. RESULTS: We identified 26,466 consecutive admissions to the
              ICU, 10,998 (42\%) of whom were mechanically ventilated and 675
              (3\%) of whom were identified as having any VAE. Any VAE was
              associated with an adjusted increased risk of death (OR, 1.91;
              95\% CI, 1.53-2.37; P < .0001). The automated algorithm was
              reliable (sensitivity of 93.5\%, 95\% CI, 77.2\%-98.8\%;
              specificity of 100\%, 95\% CI, 98.8\%-100\% vs a human
              abstractor). Comparison of patients with a VAE and with the
              former VAP definition yielded little agreement ($\kappa$ = 0.06).
              CONCLUSIONS: A fully automated method of identifying VAEs is
              efficient and reliable within a single institution. Although VAEs
              are strongly associated with worse patient outcomes, additional
              research is required to evaluate whether and which interventions
              can successfully prevent VAEs.",

  abstract  = "[Multiple-hypothesis testing involves guarding against much more
               complicated errors than single-hypothesis testing. Whereas we
               typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis
               test, a compound error rate is controlled for
               multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false
               discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential
               p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a
               sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its
               corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite
               approach-we fix the rejection region and then estimate its
               corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased
               applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to
               both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide
               evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the
               quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation
               of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which
               eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is
               traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented
               that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over

  abstract = "Assessing the known or intended effects of a drug using

              because of the absence of accurate data on a major confounder,
              the severity of the disease treated by this drug. To circumvent
              this problem of confounding by indication, I propose the
              case-time-control design, which does not require a measure of
              this confounder. Instead, the design uses subjects from a
              conventional case-control design as their own controls and thus
              requires that exposure be measurable at two or more points in
              time. I present a logistic model to estimate relative risks under
              this design and illustrate the method with data from a
              case-control study of 129 cases of fatal or near-fatal asthma and
              655 controls. The exposure of interest was quantity of use of
              inhaled beta-agonists, drugs prescribed for the treatment of
              asthma. I found that the ``best'' estimate of relative risk for
              high vs low beta-agonist use using the conventional case-control
              approach is 3.1 [95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.8-5.4], which
              inherently includes the confounding effect of unmeasured
              severity. The corresponding estimate of drug effect using the
              proposed case-time-control approach is 1.2 (95\% CI = 0.5-3.0),
              which excludes the confounding effect of unmeasured severity.
              This example indicates that the class of beta-agonists may not
              play the leading role attributed to it in the risk of fatal or
              near-fatal asthma, as had been previously suspected, except

              Score (FOKIS) is an automatically calculated score that combines
              AKI and FO in one numeric quantifiable metric. This study
              analyzed the association between FOKIS and VAE. Design:
              Retrospective matched case control study. Setting: A freestanding
              children's hospital. Patients: A total of 168 who were ventilated
              > 2 days. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: We
              identified 42 VAC cases (18 IVAC and 24 non-infection-related VAC
              cases). Controls were matched to cases for age, immunocompromised
              status and ventilator days prior to VAC. VAC cases had longer ICU

              0.001; and higher hospital mortality, 45.2 vs. 18\%, p < 0.001.
              VACs had a higher incidence of AKI, 85.7 vs. 47.3\%, p < 0.001;
              higher peak daily FO\% within 3 days preceding VAC, mean (SD),
              8.1(7.8) vs. 4.1 (3.4), p < 0.005; and higher peak FOKIS,
              6.4(3.8) vs. 3.7(2.8), (p < 0.001). Multivariate regression model
              adjusted for severity of illness identified peak FOKIS (odds

              confidence interval = 1.3-1.7) was reduced to 1.1 (0.9-1.3) when
              divided by the concurrent exposure trend odds ratio (1.4) in

               Wickham highlights compatibility with knitr and RStudio. ggplot2
               is a data visualization package for R that helps users create
               data graphics, including those that are multi-layered, with
               ease. With ggplot2, it's easy to: produce handsome,
               publication-quality plots with automatic legends created from
               the plot specificationsuperimpose multiple layers (points,
               lines, maps, tiles, box plots) from different data sources with
               automatically adjusted common scalesadd customizable smoothers
               that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as loess,
               linear models, generalized additive models, and robust
               regressionsave any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later
               modification or reusecreate custom themes that capture in-house
               or journal style requirements and that can easily be applied to
               multiple plotsapproach a graph from a visual perspective,

               the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has
               struggled with displaying data in an informative and attractive
               way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing
               data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored
               for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in
               the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce
               graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find
               it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or
